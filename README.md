# CircleMUD-python

### What is this?

This is an attempt to convert the old CircleMUD 3.1 C codebase to python.

### Why?

Because I want to bring old CircleMUD forward, which nobody seems interested
in doing. Plus it will be a good learning opportunity for me to work on various
development processes in Python.

### Can I contribute?

Sure, if you want. This project will not do the specific herculean memory
management tasks that CircleMUD does in its original codebase.
